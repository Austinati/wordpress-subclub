== Description ==

A plugin that lets you earn money by turning your free blog into a premium blog using sub.club, the new, decentralized creator payments platform. Your premium blog posts will be on the Fediverse (aka ActivityPub), and your readers will be able to view them in Mastodon and Fediverse apps such as Ivory, Ice Cubes, Mammoth and many more. And of course readers can also just read premium posts on the web, using any web browser.

Once you have installed and activated the SubClub plugin, follow these steps to use it:

1. Set Your SubClub API Key:

   - Navigate to the `Settings` section in your WordPress admin dashboard.
   - Click on the `SubClub` settings section.
   - Enter your SubClub API key in the provided field and save the changes.

2. Create a Premium Post:

   - When composing a new post in WordPress, you will see a `SubClub` meta box on the right-hand side of the editor.
   - In the `SubClub` meta box, you can choose to make the post a Premium post by selecting the appropriate option.
   - By doing this, a premium post will be created on SubClub, and the WordPress post will include a link to the premium post on SubClub.
   - Optionally, you can also include an excerpt that you defined while composing the post.

By following these steps, you can easily create and manage premium content on SubClub directly from your WordPress site.
